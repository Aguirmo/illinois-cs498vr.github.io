You will review three VR experiences according to the [Oculus Best Practices Guide](https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/book-bp/). These VR experiences can be from the Oculus Store, the Steam Store, a paid experience provided by a TA (see piazza for a list of these experiences), or a student demo from the CS498 `V:` drive (in the “Student Projects” folder). For each VR experience, write one paragraph for each category (categories detailed below) that describes what the experience does well, and what it does poorly. You should write about 150-300 words for each experience [(example)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/awvd1536q1dijwq/MP3_Example.pdf?dl=0). There is no right or wrong answer. *You will be graded according to how well you can justify your answer with specific examples from the Oculus Best Practices Guide.* This assignment is meant to turn you into a VR snob; pick apart every little design decision you can think of.

#### Categories:
1. Graphical/Aesthetic Quality
1. User interface
1. Movement
1. Immersion/Presence

#### Grading:
- Each review must cover all four categories. 
- **YOU MUST PROVIDE PAGE NUMBER(S) FROM THE BEST PRACTICES GUIDE TO CITE A GIVEN OBSERVATION** 
- **YOU MAY NOT CITE FROM THE FIRST NINE PAGES.** (these are just the overview)
- Each review must include at least two suggested improvements that are consistent with the Best Practices Guide. 
- Each of the three reviews counts for 1/3rd of your assignment grade.  
- Reviews that do not fit the word limit will result in 20% deduction
- Spelling and grammar mistakes will result in 10% deduction

It is strongly encouraged that you make explicit reference to specific points from the Best Practices Guide whenever possible.  If you explain your ratings well, and it is clear you have read and understood the Best Practices Guide, then you will receive full credit. 

#### Example Citation:
"The menu feels too close to the eyes which may cause discomfort.  Instead, UI elements should be incorporated into the virtual world as 3D objects (p.6)." (except, don't cite from the first 9 pages)

#### Submission:
Submit your reviews on Compass as a double-spaced .pdf. The filename should contain the NetIDs of everyone in the group separated by underscores (e.g., MP3_widdwsn2_aiellis1.pdf).
