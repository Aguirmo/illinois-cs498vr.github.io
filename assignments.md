## Lab Information ##
The lab computers are Falcon Northwest PCs with dual 27-inch monitors, NVidia GeForce Titan Black or 1080 graphics cards, Windows 10, Visual Studio, and [standard EWS-provided software](https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews-windows-lab-software). Each computer has an Oculus Rift CV1 (donated by Oculus/Facebook), an XBox controller, and two Touch Controllers.

If you choose to develop outside the lab, you should test and experience your work at least once on the lab computers, as we will also grade your work there.

Unfortunately, we have only 20 workstations and over 200 students. Therefore, you should start early on assignments and work in the lab during less popular times. Unless announced otherwise, the lab is available 24/7.
