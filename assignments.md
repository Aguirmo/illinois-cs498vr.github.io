## Lab Information ##
The lab computers are Falcon Northwest PCs with dual 27-inch monitors, NVidia GeForce Titan Black graphics cards, Windows 10, Visual Studio, and [standard EWS-provided software](https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews-windows-lab-software). Each computer has an Oculus Rift CV1 (donated by Oculus/Facebook), an XBox controller, and two Touch Controllers.

If you choose to develop outside the lab, you should test and experience your work at least once on the lab computers, as we will also grade your work there.

Unfortunately, we have only 20 workstations and over 200 students. Therefore, you should start early on assignments and work in the lab during less popular times. The 4107 lab is generally available 24/7.

## Assignment Policies ##

- Read the submission instructions in each handout carefully!
- You must work in pairs on all assignments. We recommend using Piazza to find a group.
- We will accept assignments only up to two days late, with a 20% penalty.

## Regrade Requests ##
To submit a regrade request, create a private Piazza post with a brief explanation why you think you were graded incorrectly, within one week after we release grades on a given assignment.

For MPs:

- The course staff will regrade MPs.
- Include NetIDs for both you **and your partner**.
- For major issues, e.g. a submission issue resulted in a zero, we will regrade your work within 3 weeks.
- Otherwise, we may not regrade your work until after all MPs have finished.

For exams:

- The course instructor will regrade exams.
- Include a brief description of the question.

## Academic Integrity ##
We expect that you are familiar with the Student Code's [definitions on academic integrity](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html).
