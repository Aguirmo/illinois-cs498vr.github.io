Zen Garden is a visual and physical experience that draws from the influences of companies like Team Labs, Valve, and Oculus. Our aim was to create a small island that combines visual, auditory, and physical interaction to immerse the user and create a project that feels natural and real. In “The Garden” we have two large passive interactions (the forest of lights and the flower walk), and two main active interactions (the flower garden and the shooting range). In addition, there are several animals that may caw at you, follow you, or just stare to help create a world that feels more alive. All these details form one large piece of digital art, and there’s no better way to experience it than in VR.

Built in Fall 2018, for the Oculus Rift.
