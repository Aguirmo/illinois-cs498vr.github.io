Our project is a tutorial that teaches you how to use a micropipette, a lab tool often used in biological wet lab experiments. In a secret lab on a mountain island, you’ll learn the basic controls of a micropipette and perform some basic procedures. This project is intended as an educational experience for students who may not have access to expensive equipment, and allows them the opportunity to learn and explore without risk of damaging the lab. The controls –and experiments—closely mirror those of an actual pipette user, as does the fatigue and sometimes frustration associated with it. Enjoy!

Built in Fall 2018, for the Oculus Rift.
