This project is both game and educational tool. Its purpose is to illustrate how hard it is to drive safely while being distracted with your phone and your music. Driving is fun and comfortable, but you must avoid hitting the AI pedestrians and other cars, otherwise the police will catch you. So, avoid hitting anything, send texts, play your own music (custom music is supported), and even take a drink out of the bottle of drink in the cup holder. Beware, once you lose all your points, its game over!

Built in Fall 2018, for the Oculus Rift.
