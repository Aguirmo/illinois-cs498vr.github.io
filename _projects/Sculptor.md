Create your very own sculptures! Using our implementation of Paul Bourke's algorithm for interpolated Marching Cubes, create 3D art in real time by adding and subtracting from the sculpture. Sculptor VR also features dynamic painting, saving/resuming progress, and a beginner friendly step-by-step tutorial. Also provided is a studio full of inspiring sculptures, ranging in style from ancient roman to contemporary modern.
