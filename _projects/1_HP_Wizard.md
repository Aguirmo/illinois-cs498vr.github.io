A multi-level, first-person fantasy strategy game. It only takes a single hit to defeat you! Outnumbered, you will need to act quickly. Conjure spells on the spot and defend yourself against hordes of advancing enemies. Featuring our own unique low-poly art style. Spell gestures are driven by our self-developed Machine Learning models.

Built in Fall 2018, for the Oculus Rift.
