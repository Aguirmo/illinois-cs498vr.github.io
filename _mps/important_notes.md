1. Read all submission instructions carefully​, and submit all required
documents. If you are missing some files (in either submission), but
we can still grade, you will be docked 20%. If we are
unable to grade due to missing documents, you will get a 0.
2. Oculus demos need a TA to be present in order to install them.
Steam/Student demos do not.
3. [Google​](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=google), the ​[Unity Documentation​](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html), the ​[Unity Wiki​](https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Main_Page), and the ​[Unity
Forums​](https://forum.unity.com/) are excellent sources of information, 
especially as you start to use more advanced features of Unity.
4. To earn extra credit, you must submit with a partner. Use the Piazza
teammate search function to help find one, or just chat up your
neighbors in lecture.
5. Check Piazza for any bugs, updates, or important information for this MP.
6. Save the project on your EWS drive (usually the U: drive). The U: drive 
is available across all of the computers in the lab. If you save to the C: 
drive, your project will only exist on that single computer.
